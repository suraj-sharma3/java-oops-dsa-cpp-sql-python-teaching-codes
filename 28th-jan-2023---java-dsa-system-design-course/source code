/*

when we want to declare multiple variables of the same datatype, we can declare all of them at one in a single line 
int num, age, roomNumber;
we can also do chaining while storing values in many variables
int a, b, c, d;
a = b = c = d = 55;
here we are first assigning 55 to 'd' & then we're assigning value of 'd' to 'c' & so on

compound assignment : 
a += 5; // this means 5 will be first added to the existing value of a & then the result will be stored in a 
here we are performing the operation while we are assigning the value 

b -= 5;

We can do compound assignment with all the arithmetic operators
e.g. a *= 5, a /= 2, a %= 3, a += 5, a -= 1

Relational Operators : <, >, <=, >=, ==, != (these operators return result only in terms of 'true' or 'false')
relational operators return boolean values only
= : assignment operator 
== : equal to operator (checks if 2 values are equal or not)

a <= b means a < b or a == b, if any of these 2 conditions is true, the answer is true otherwise the answer is false
a >= b means a > b or a == b, if any of these 2 conditions is true, the answer is true otherwise the answer is false
